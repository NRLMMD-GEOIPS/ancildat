ancildat GeoIPS Plugin
======================

The ancildat package is a GeoIPS-compatible plugin, intended to be used within the GeoIPS ecosystem.
Please see the
[GeoIPS Documentation](https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#readme)
for more information on the GeoIPS plugin architecture and base infrastructure.

Package Overview
-----------------

The ancildat package includes fortran code with Python wrappers for reading
in and using various ancillary datasets within GeoIPS.  This includes
elevation, rayleigh scattering look up tables, climatology, etc.


System Requirements
---------------------

* geoips >= 1.12.0
* Test data repos contained in $GEOIPS_TESTDATA_DIR for tests to pass.

IF REQUIRED: Install base geoips package
------------------------------------------------------------
SKIP IF YOU HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED BASE GEOIPS ENVIRONMENT

If GeoIPS Base is not yet installed, follow the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/geoips#installation)
within the geoips source repo documentation:

Install ancildat package
----------------------------
```bash
    # Assuming you followed the fully supported installation,
    # using $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR and $GEOIPS_CONFIG_FILE:
    source $GEOIPS_CONFIG_FILE
    git clone https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/fortran_utils $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/fortran_utils
    git clone https://github.com/NRLMMD-GEOIPS/ancildat $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/ancildat

    # NOTE: currently, fortran_utils must be pip installed BEFORE pip installing
    # ancildat.  Including fortran_utils as a dependency within ancildat pyproject.toml
    # initially resulted in incorrect installation paths, so more work required to
    # get the pip dependencies working properly for fortran installations via
    # pyproject.toml with the poetry backend.
    pip install -e $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/fortran_utils
    pip install -e $GEOIPS_PACKAGES_DIR/ancildat
```

Test ancildat installation
-----------------------------
```bash

    # Ensure GeoIPS Python environment is enabled.

    # ancildat package is used for True Color, cirrus detection, cloud layer, and other products.
    # Test those products to test ancildat functionality
```
